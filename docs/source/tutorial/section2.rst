Advanced processing
------------------------------

.. _section2:

This section will guide you through advanced processing of files in RAW. It includes:
pair-distance distribution analysis using GNOM, DIFT and BIFT methods, ambiguity assessment
for shape reconstructions, 3D reconstructions with bead models and electron density,
aligning 3D reconstructions with PDB files, calculating theoretica profiles from
models using CRYSOL and PDB2SAS, SEC-SAXS data deconvolution using
singular value decomposition (SVD) and evolving factor analysis (EFA), baseline
corrections for SEC-SAXS data, and regularized alternating least squares (REGALS)
of SEC-SAXS and other SAXS data. It refers to the :ref:`RAW tutorial data <tutorialdata>`.
