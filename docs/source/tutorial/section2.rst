Advanced processing
------------------------------

.. _section2:

This section will guide you through advanced processing of files in RAW. It includes:
pair-distance distribution analysis using GNOM and BIFT methods, ambiguity assessment
for shape reconstructions, 3D reconstructions with bead models and electron density,
aligning 3D reconstructions with PDB files, SEC-SAXS data deconvolution using
singular value decomposition (SVD) and evolving factor
analysis (EFA), and baseline corrections for SEC-SAXS data. It refers to the
:ref:`RAW tutorial data <tutorialdata>`.
