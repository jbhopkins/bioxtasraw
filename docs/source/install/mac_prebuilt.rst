Using a prebuilt app package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _macprebuilt:

The recommended way to install RAW on Mac is using a prebuilt app package. To install
from a prebuilt app package simply download the :file:`RAW-{x}.{y}.{z}_mac_{platform}.dmg`
(where :file:`{x}.{y}.{z}` is the version number and :file:`{platform}` is x86_64 for
Intel macs and arm64 for Apple Silicon macs) file from sourceforge (
`https://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw <https://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw>`_),
double click it to open the dmg, and drag the :file:`RAW.app` file to your Applications folder
(or wherever you want to install RAW).

Direct links to the downloads:

*   `Apple Silicon macs (M1 or newer chips) <https://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw/files/RAW-2.3.1_mac_arm64.dmg/download>`_

*   `Intel macs (pre-M1 chips) <https://sourceforge.net/projects/bioxtasraw/files/RAW-2.3.1_mac_x86_64.dmg/download>`_


**Important Notes:**

*   With some version of the RAW installer, you may get a warning message
    the first time you run the program. If that happens, right click on RAW and
    select :menuselection:`Open` from the right click menu, and then click
    the :guilabel:`Open` button in the window that appears.

    *   *Note:* This requires administrator permissions.
